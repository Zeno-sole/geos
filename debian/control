Description: Geometry engine for GIS - Development files
 GEOS provides a spatial object model and fundamental geometric
 functions. It implements the geometry model defined in the
 OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL.

 This package contains the headers and libraries needed to
 develop programs using GEOS.

Description: Geometry engine for GIS - C++ development files
 GEOS provides a spatial object model and fundamental geometric
 functions. It implements the geometry model defined in the
 OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL.
 .
 This package contains the headers and libraries needed to
 develop programs using GEOS in C++. Note that third-parties
 programs should use the stable C API instead of the
 unstable C++ one.

Description: Geometry engine for Geographic Information Systems - C Library
 GEOS provides a spatial object model and fundamental geometric
 functions. It implements the geometry model defined in the
 OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL.
 Functions provided include:
 .
   * spatial predicates (based on the DE-9IM model),
   * overlay functions (intersection, difference, union,
     symmetric difference),
   * buffer,
   * convex hull,
   * area and distance functions, and
   * topological validity checking
 .
 This package contains the C library.
